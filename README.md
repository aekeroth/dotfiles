# Andreas's dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles.

It is heavily inspired by [Paul's](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles) and [Mathias's](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) dotfiles. 

## Installation

Clone the repository wherever you want. The sync script will then pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aekeroth/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./sync.sh
```
